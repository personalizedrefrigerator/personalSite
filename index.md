# About this site

This site is built with the [Jekyll Hematite theme](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/jekyll-hematite-theme), a theme I originally created for a course website. As of September 2022, it hasn't been used for this, but it also seems to work well for personal websites!

As the Google Summer of Code program's final reflection requirement can be satisfied using a post on a website, this website has been created.
