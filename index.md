# About this site

This site is built with the [Jekyll Hematite theme](https://github.com/personalizedrefrigerator/jekyll-hematite-theme), a theme I originally created for a course website.

As the Google Summer of Code program's final reflection requirement can be satisfied using a post on a website, this website has been created.
