## A Personal Website
Initially created in mid-2018, this source for this website has been uploaded to GitHub as it lacked a version control system. 
This site, previously, was managed by Google's Firebase Static Hosting.

## Hosting it Locally
Cloning this repository and attempting to open its source files in a browser might be troublesome. Links may break. Problems might occur. As such, it can be hosted locally with Python.

With an installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), simply run
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
in the root directory of this application. Python should provide a link to a local hosting of the website.
