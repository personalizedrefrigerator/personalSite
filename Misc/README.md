## A Personal Website
Initially created in mid-2018, this source for this website has been uploaded to GitHub as it lacked a version control system. 
This site, previously, was managed by Google's Firebase Static Hosting.

## Installation Instructions
As this is licenced under version three of the GPL, I feel obligated to provide some sort of installation instructions. 
With an installation of (Python 3)[https://www.python.org/], simply run
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
in the root directory of this application. Python should provide a link to a local hosting of the website.
