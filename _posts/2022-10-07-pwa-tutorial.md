# Summary
This page contains a textual representation of the content to be [presented here][slides-link].

<details markdown=1><summary>What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?</summary>

According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps),
> Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features in combination with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native apps.
>
> <cite>— Mozilla Developer Networks</cite>

In short, PWAs are websites that act like native apps (e.g. are installable, display notifications, etc.), *while still working properly on browsers that don't support newer PWA features*.
