# This page's theme

This page uses the [Jekyll Hematite theme][jekyll-hematite-github], a theme created in late 2022 with the intention of usage for course websites (I created it for a course I was TAing).

# What it supports

 * Math via \\(\KaTeX\\)
 * ```javascript
alert('Code highlighting that changes with the website\'s theme');
```
 * [A calendar layout](https://personalizedrefrigerator.github.io/jekyll-hematite-theme/example/calendar/)
 * [User-configurable settings]({{ '/assets/html/settings/' | absolute_url }})
 * Much more!

See [its website](https://personalizedrefrigerator.github.io/jekyll-hematite-theme/) for more on what it supports!
